# Awesome applied optimal transport
This is my repo of collection  and notes of various OT papers and projects. As i am a engineer my collection focuses on applications of OT though there will be some cool theory papers from time to time. 

## Dataset similarity
* OTDD: Geometric Dataset Distances via Optimal Transport [Code](https://github.com/microsoft/otdd), [paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/file/f52a7b2610fb4d3f74b4106fb80b233d-Paper.pdf)
One of the best papers for dataset similarity and optimal transport applications. Still want to know if it can be replaced by transport dependency.

* Dataset Dynamics via Gradient Flows in Probability Space.[[code](https://github.com/microsoft/otdd)
[paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/alvarez-melis21a/alvarez-melis21a.pdf)], Basically you can flow the dataset from one to another, can be used ni transfer learning

* HHOT:
